I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) affiliated with the [Learning Systems and Robotics Lab](https://www.learnsyslab.org). My research is on embodied AI, specifically Bayesian optimization for robot learning, as well as risk-aware and robust reinforcement learning.

I conducted my PhD research at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de) as a member of the [Intelligent Control Systems Group](https://ics.is.mpg.de/) and [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de) at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de), both led by [Prof. Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/DSME/Das-Institut/Team-CMS-Artikel-/~jlolt/Prof-Sebastian-Trimpe). I was an associated scholar with the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), and my PhD was supported by [IAV](https://www.iav.com).

Before joining the Max Planck Institute, I studied **Computer Science** at the University of Lübeck. I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Electrical Engineering** from BHT Berlin. Between these degrees, I worked as a full-time **Software Engineer** in Hamburg.

For a list of my research papers, see my [Publications page](https://avrohr.com/publications/). More information about my teaching activities is available [here](https://avrohr.com/teaching/).
