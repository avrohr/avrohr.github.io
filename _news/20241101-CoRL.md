Next week, Iâ€™ll be at the [2024 Conference on Robot Learning](https://www.corl.org/), representing the [Robotics Institute Germany](https://www.robotics-institute-germany.de/) in the exhibition hall. We'll also be presenting our work on [Latent Action Priors From a Single Gait Cycle Demonstration for Online Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03246) at the [LocoLearn: From Bioinspired Gait Generation to Active Perception](https://www.locolearn.robot-learning.net/) workshop, and [Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lSah6an1Ar) at the [SAFE-ROL: Safe and Robust Robot Learning for Operation in the Real World](https://sites.google.com/view/corl-2024-safe-rol-workshop) workshop.
