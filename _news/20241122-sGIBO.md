Our new preprint on [Simulation-Aided Policy Tuning for Black-Box Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14246) is finally online! This research tackles the challenge of data-efficient fine-tuning of robot behaviors. Building on our prior work, we propose a local Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both robot experiments and simulation to speed up learning. Check out the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14246) and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iSUzwjN7ko) for more details!
