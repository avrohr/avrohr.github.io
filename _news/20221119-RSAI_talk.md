I'm excited to share that today I gave a talk on [Local Policy Search with Bayesian Gradient Estimates](https://www.ai.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/ykxfx) at the [Research Seminar on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.rwth-aachen.de/cms/KI/Das-KI-Center/Aktuelle-Veranstaltungen/~fibvf/Forschungsseminar-zu-KI-Video-Object-Se/?lidx=1), which was organized by the [RWTH Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.rwth-aachen.de).
