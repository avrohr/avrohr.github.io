I recently attended the [57th Control Engineering Colloquium in Boppard](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/events/control-engineering-colloquium-boppard.html) and it was a nice platform to share my research and discuss with other researchers in the field. I'm happy to announce that my presentation was chosen as the runner-up for the best presentation award, making the experience even more rewarding.
