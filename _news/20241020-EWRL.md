Iâ€™m excited to be presenting our new work on [Viability of Future Actions: Robust Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Regularization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zP9hpDEzPq) at the [European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl17-2024/) in Toulouse, France, from 28-30 October 2024. Looking forward to great discussions!
