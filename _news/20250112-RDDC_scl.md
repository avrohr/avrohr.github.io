I'm excited to share our paper [Robust Direct Data-Driven Control for Probabilistic Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167691124002998) is now published in [Systems & Control Letters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/systems-and-control-letters)!

This work introduces a method for robust experience transfer, enabling learning-based controller designs shared over multiple systems. Using just a few trajectories, our approach guarantees robustness and ensures safe operation out of the box.
