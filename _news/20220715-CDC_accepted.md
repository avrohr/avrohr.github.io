Our two submissions [Improving the Performance of Robust Control through Event-Triggered Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14252) and [On Controller Tuning with Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11120) for the [IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)](https://cdc2022.ieeecss.org/) were accepted. We will present the papers at the [Invited Session on Learning-â€‹based Control](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-zeilinger/events/learning-control-session.html).
