I am thrilled to share that my former Master's student and now colleague, [Paul Brunzema](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/brunzema), has won the 2022 student award of the [SEW-EURODRIVE Foundation](https://www.sew-eurodrive-stiftung.de/en/#student-award) for our work on **Learning and Forgetting in Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization**.
