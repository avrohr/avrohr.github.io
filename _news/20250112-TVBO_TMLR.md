Pleased to announce that our latest paper, [Event-Triggered Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WEYMCLu8u7), is published in the [Transactions on Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/index.html).

This work introduces **ET-GP-UCB**, an algorithm that adaptively resets its optimization process in response to changes in a time-varying objective function, achieving efficient performance without prior knowledge of change rates.
