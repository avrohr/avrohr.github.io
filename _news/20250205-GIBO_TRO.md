Our work on [Simulation-Aided Policy Tuning for Black-Box Robot Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874195) has been published in the [IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ro) and is now available in [early access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874195).

Our new approach combines real-world & simulated data to fine-tune robot skills efficiently. See it in action: [https://youtu.be/feMKxdnGXL4](https://youtu.be/feMKxdnGXL4).
