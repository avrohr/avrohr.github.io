I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) affiliated with the [Learning Systems and Robotics Lab](https://www.learnsyslab.org). My research focuses on Bayesian optimization for robot learning, as well as risk-aware and robust reinforcement learning.

During the first part of my PhD, I conducted research at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de) as a member of the [Intelligent Control Systems Group](https://ics.is.mpg.de/), led by [Prof. Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/DSME/Das-Institut/Team-CMS-Artikel-/~jlolt/Prof-Sebastian-Trimpe). Later, I relocated with my research group to [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de), where we established the new [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de). Throughout this period, I was associated with the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), and my PhD was supported by [IAV](https://www.iav.com).

Before joining the Max Planck Institute for my master's thesis and later pursuing my PhD in 2018, I studied **Computer Science** at the University of Lübeck. I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Electrical Engineering** from BHT Berlin in 2013. Between these degrees, I worked as a full-time **Software Engineer** in Hamburg.
